Airline Control Program Code
The last "free" release of ACP, 9.2.1, was intended for use in bank card and similar applications. It was shipped on a "mini-reel" which contained a complete ACP system, and its libraries for restoration to IBM 3340 DASD packs. From that complete system one could easily create derivative works. A hypervisor was included, which allowed OS/370 VS1 or VS2 (SVS or MVS) to be run as a "guest" OS under ACP itself. The end-user documentation, which was shipped with the tape, took almost 60 linear inches of shelf space.  I want a copy of that "mini-rell" PLEASE or better a copy on a DVD.
